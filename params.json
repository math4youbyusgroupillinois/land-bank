The agency won't have the resources to invest in every property, and the appropriate policy strategies from community to community.\r\n\r\n![web app screenshot](https://raw.github.com/dssg/dssg.github.io/master/img/posts/land-bank-screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nOur purpose was to create a web tool to view and understand Cook County's property data, and to analyze it in order to help the CCLBA develop its policy strategies.\r\n\r\n1. Build a usable web interface for both public use and for use by land bank employees that interfaces with a Postgres database in order to organize, query, and access the data in a convenient manner.\r\n2. Create a model that will determine the critera by which the Cook County Land Bank which neighborhoods to help first, which properties in that neighborhood, and their potential new uses.\r\n\r\n**[Read more about our analysis in the wiki](../../wiki/Analysis)**\r\n\r\n## The data: property and building data from Cook County and the City of Chicago\r\n- Property data from the Cook County Assessor and Recorder of Deeds, courtsety of the Institute for Housing Studies\r\n- Cook County parcel shapefile from County GIS department\r\n- City of Chicago open data portal datasets\r\n- ACS demographic data from the Census Bureau\r\n- Brownfield data from the EPA\r\n\r\n**[Read more about the data we used in the wiki](../../wiki/Data)**\r\n\r\n## Project layout\r\n- `analysis`: exploratory data analsys of real estate and demographic tends in Cook County.\r\n- `web`: a django app that implements the analytics tool and a data API backend to power this tool.\r\n\r\n**[Read more about the analysis and webapp in the wiki](../../wiki)**\r\n\r\n## Installation guide\r\n\r\nHere's the software you'll need to install:\r\n\r\n- GIS software: ArcGIS 10.1 or QGIS\r\n- Postgres 9.1\r\n- PostGIS\r\n- Python 2.7.x\r\n- Numpy  1.7.1\r\n- Sympy  0.7.2\r\n\r\nNext, clone the repository and configure Django to enable South and TastyPie, and to interface with your Postgres database.\r\n\r\nThen, run an initial South migration to create database tables/views:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python manage.py schemamigration landbank_data --initial\r\n$ python manage.py migrate landbank_data\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, modify and run load_*.py scripts with desired input files to populate base tables.\r\n\r\n## Team\r\n![Team](https://raw.github.com/dssg/dssg.github.io/761993c24ea2991170ef64048115cb805f5f13fb/img/people/teams/landbank.png)\r\n\r\n## Contributing to the project\r\nTo get involved, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dssg/bikeshare/issues).\r\n\r\nTo get in touch, email Tom Plagge at tplagge@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship at the University of Chicago](http://dssg.io)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
